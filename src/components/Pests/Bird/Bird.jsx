Whether itâ€™s pest pigeons roosting on ledges or sparrows nesting in air ducts, the resulting droppings, noise, and property damage require immediate professional intervention. At Accurate Pest Control, we offer reliable bird control in Dubai that safeguards your home, garden, or commercial premises. Bird infestations are common across the UAE, especially in high-rise structures, warehouses, and heritage sites. Nesting materials and acidic droppings not only spoil building exteriors but can also transmit bacteria and parasites. Our goal is not only to remove but to humanely deter and prevent re-entry using science-backed strategies.`}
