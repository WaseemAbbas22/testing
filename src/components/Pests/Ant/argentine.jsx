        description={`The tiny, light to dark brown Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) are famous for establishing large colonies and breaking into houses and other structures. Originating in South America, these ants have spread all over the world and are especially tenacious in hot climates like Dubai. They frequently enter through foundations, pipes, and cracks and are attracted to moist, sugary meals.Their sheer numbers and ability to relocate quickly make professional control necessary.`}
