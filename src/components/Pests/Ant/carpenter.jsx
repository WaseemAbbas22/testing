        description={`Carpenter ants are large ants that are known to bore tunnels into wood in order to build nests. While they don't consume wood like termites, their excavation can cause serious structural damage over time. Often black or dark brown, these ants are commonly found in wooden structures, wall voids, and damp areas. Quick identification and treatment are essential to avoid costly repairs.`}
