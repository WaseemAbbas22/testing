        description={`SThe Arabian Cobra is one of the most dangerous venomous snakes found in the Arabian Peninsula, including certain outskirts of Dubai. Easily identified by its hooded neck and hissing posture, this snake prefers dry, rocky environments but can occasionally find its way into human settlements, especially in villas near desert landscapes, construction sites, or neglected storage areas.
        There are significant health risks associated with a cobra on or near your property, even if sightings are uncommon in central urban areas. Immediate identification and professional handling are critical to avoid bites or panic.`}
