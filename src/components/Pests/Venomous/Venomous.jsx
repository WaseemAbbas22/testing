          desc2="Snake sightings, even non-venomous ones, can cause fear, stress, and hygiene concerns in any home. These reptiles often hide in basements, shaded areas, gardens, or outdoor storage spaces, making them hard to detect. Their droppings and shed skin can lead to sanitation problems and even damage property. Snakes may enter through open vents, cracks, or door gaps. DIY methods are risky and usually ineffective. For safe and reliable removal, itâ€™s best to call professional snake control services."
