        description={`It is a notorious vector responsible for spreading malaria across many regions, including Dubai and the wider UAE. Known for its slender body, long legs, and resting posture with the body at an angle, this mosquito is often mistaken for a big mosquito due to its elongated shape. Unlike the Aedes, the Anopheles bites primarily at night, making evening protection essential.
These mosquitoes breed in still, clear water and are most active from sunset to sunrise. Because the female must feed on blood to develop eggs, even a small population can become a serious health risk without professional help.`}
