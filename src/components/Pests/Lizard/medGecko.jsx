        description={`The Mediterranean Gecko is a widespread reptile in Dubai, commonly seen clinging to walls, ceilings, and windows during warm nights. Known for their translucent skin, sticky toe pads, and fast movements, these geckos can quickly take over your home or office space if not managed properly.
While they help reduce insect populations, including small flies and mosquitoes, their presence indoors can be alarming. Just like a gecko lizard, the Mediterranean variety hides during the day and becomes active at night, often drawn to artificial lights where prey insects gather.`}
