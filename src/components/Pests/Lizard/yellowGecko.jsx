        description={`The yellow-bellied house gecko is a small, agile lizard that commonly invades Dubai homes, especially at night. The pale yellow underside, sticky toes, and flying motions across walls and ceilings are characteristics of these reptiles. Though not harmful to humans, their presence can be unsettling and often indicates a larger insect population nearby.`}

        Heading1="Why You Might Be Seeing Geckos Indoors"
        desc1="Being proactive, geckos usually enter homes to find insects, warmth, and secure hiding places. If your property has outdoor lights, open vents, or cracked windows, it may attract more than just bugs and it could be inviting geckos as well.
The House Gecko, a close cousin of the yellow-bellied variety, is equally common in residential spaces across the UAE. Both species tend to follow the same behavior patterns, feeding on moths, ants, and small roaches while nesting in dark crevices or behind furniture."
