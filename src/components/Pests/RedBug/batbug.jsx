        description={`Bat bugs look almost identical to baby bed bugs, which often leads to misidentification. Though similar to Cimex lectularius, they primarily feed on bats and are usually found in attics, wall voids, or near chimneys where bats nest. However, when bats leave or die, bat bugs migrate indoors and start biting humans. They donâ€™t spread disease, but can cause itching, irritation, and allergic reactions, requiring prompt action and best pest control practices.`}
