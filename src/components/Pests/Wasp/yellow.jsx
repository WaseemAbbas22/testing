        description={`Often mistaken for bees, yellowjackets are aggressive stinging wasps with eye-catching black and yellow bodies. Unlike the more docile yellow paper wasp, yellowjackets are extremely territorial and can sting multiple times, posing serious threats to people, pets, and outdoor gatherings. Their nests, often hidden underground or inside walls, can grow into massive colonies without obvious warning.
If you've noticed sudden wasp swarms near your property, immediate yellow jacket removal is critical to ensure safety and avoid painful stings.`}
