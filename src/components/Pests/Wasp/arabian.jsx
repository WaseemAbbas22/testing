        description={`The Arabian paper wasp is a slender-bodied stinging insect commonly found across Dubai and surrounding desert regions. This species, which can be identified by its long legs and yellow-black stripes, constructs umbrella-shaped nests beneath building roofs, tree branches, and protected corners. While not as aggressive as hornets, they will defend their nest if disturbed, especially during warmer months when their activity levels are at their peak.
We at Accurate Pest Control Services LLC Dubai,Â  provide professional wasp removal services with a focus on long-term prevention, speed, and safety. Whether at your villa, garden, or business property, we ensure the complete elimination of nests and wasps before they become a hazard.`}
